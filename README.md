# AMbulanta doktorice Zdravke
A children's game developed for HRT during my time at Gamechuck, designed to provide a fun and educational experience for young players.

# Gameplay:
- At the beginning of the game, a friendly snail explains which children are sick and what tasks need to be done to help them.
- Players navigate to the children's houses by clicking on them and then play a series of interactive minigames to assist each child.
- The game features playful music and vibrant, colorful assets, creating an engaging and joyful atmosphere.
  
This project highlights my experience in creating fun, interactive, and family-friendly game experiences.
